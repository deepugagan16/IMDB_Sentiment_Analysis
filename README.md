## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze textual data and categorize it into various sentiment classes. The project uses a dataset from Kaggle and stores trained models in Google Drive for persistence.

## Use Case Scenarios

- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Automatically determine customer satisfaction levels from reviews.
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Track public opinion on trending topics or brands.
- **Market Research**: Analyze survey data for consumer sentiment trends.
- **Product Improvement**: Identify pain points from negative feedback.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Access to Kaggle for dataset downloads.
- Google Drive for model persistence.
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (if applicable).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Google Drive Mounting**:
   - Ensure you have a Google Drive account to store models and intermediate results.
   - Use the following code to mount your Google Drive:
     ```python
     from google.colab import drive
     drive.mount('./content')
     ```

2. **Dataset Download**:
   - Authenticate your Kaggle account by uploading the `kaggle.json` file.
   - Download the required dataset and unzip it for processing.

3. **Library Installation**:
   - Install all required Python libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Execution**:
   - Run the notebook cells sequentially to complete the process from data preparation to model training and evaluation.

## Implementation Details

### Key Steps
1. **Data Acquisition**: The dataset is fetched from Kaggle and processed.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Text normalization, tokenization, and vectorization.
   - Removal of stop words and stemming/lemmatization.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Deep Learning models:LSTMs.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics such as accuracy used to assess model performance.
5. **Persistence**:
   - Trained models are saved to Google Drive for reuse.

## Results

The trained model achieves sentiment classification with acceptable accuracy and generalizes well to unseen data. Specific results are documented in the notebook.

## Future Scope

- **Model Optimization**: Use advanced architectures like BERT for better performance.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Integrate with APIs for dynamic data analysis.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Extend the project to handle non-English text.

## Acknowledgments
